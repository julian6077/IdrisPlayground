1. Fair grouping:

grp = [?, ?, ...] -- variable allowed grouping sizes (3,4,5)

x = 1 arbitary num from grp
n = amount of projects

Grouping must solve atleast one solution to be "fair":
I.   n mod x = 0
II.  n mod x = 1		     (last group has 1 project more)
III. x – (n mod x) = 1       (         “               less)


I.   is for x = max(grp) no real solution 
(last grp will be bigger than allowed sizes)

III. is for x = min(grp) no real solution 
(last grp will be smaller than allowed sizes)



2. Fair room distribution:

less than 6 pres: all in one room

grp sizes mod (count rooms) = 0:  no mix of rooms inside grps and even distribution of rooms

otherwise : equal distirbution of rooms alphabetically
[[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11]]
-> flatten
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
ceil (11 / x) = z
first z presentations in the first room, etc.
